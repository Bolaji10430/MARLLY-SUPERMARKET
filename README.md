## INCONCLUSION
In conclusion, the essence of data visualization is to give cogent information that will be needed for effective decision-making in the supermarket. I have been able to deduce so far about the progress of the supermarket. The management of the supermarket should take note of the top-performing products and disburse more resources to keep them effective and efficient. While the less-performing products should also be monitored or neglected if they are no relevant. This information or data will be monitored as a project and seen as a policy to fast-track the development of Mally supermarket.
